				"This bestiary is for storytellers and worldbuilders. If you have ever thought about running a Dungeons & Dragons game for your friends, either a single night's adventure or a long-running campaign, this tome contains page after page of inspiration. It's your one-stop shop for creatures both malevolent and benign.",
				"Some of the creatures that inhabit the worlds of D&D have origins rooted in real-world mythology and fantasy literature. Other creatures are D&D originals. The monsters in this book have been culled from all previous editions of the game. Herein you'll discover classic critters such as the beholder and the displacer beast next to more recent creations such as the chuul and the twig blight. Common beasts mingle with the weird, the terrifying, and the ridiculous. In collecting monsters from the past, we've endeavored to reflect the multifaceted nature of the game, warts and all. D&D monsters come in all shapes and sizes, with stories that not only thrill us but also make us smile.",
				"If you're an experienced Dungeon Master (DM), a few of the monster write-ups might surprise you, for we've gone into the {@i Monster Manuals} of yore and discovered some long-lost factoids. We've also added a few new twists. Naturally, you can do with these monsters what you will. Nothing we say here is intended to curtail your creativity. If the minotaures in your world are shipbuilders and pirates, who are we to argue with you? It's your world, after all.",

You might read a monster's entry and be spurred to create an adventure revolving around it, or you might have an awesome idea for a dungeon and need just the right monsters to populate it. That's where the Monster Manual comes in handy.",

That book also contains wandering monster tables and other goodies to help you use the monsters in this book in interesting ways, as well as advice for modifying monsters and creating your own.",

								"Les {@b Aberracions} són éssers foranis a aquesta realitat. Molts tenen habilitats màgiques que surten de la seva ment extranya i no de les forces místiques del món. Exemples: aboleths, espectadors, flagela-ments, i slaadi.",
								"Les {@b Bèsties} són criatures no humanoides naturals de l'escosistema del món. Alguns tenen poders màgics, però la majoria no són intel·ligents i no viuen en societat ni tenen idioma. Exemples: animals ordinaris, dinosaures, i animals de tamany gegant.",
								"Els {@b Celestials} són criatures dels Plans Superiors. Moltes són servents de divinitats que envien missatges o fan la seva voluntat al pla mortal (i en altres). Els celestials són bons per naturalesa, i és extrany que un se surti de l'alineament bo. Exemples: angels, couatls, i pegassos.",
								"Els {@b Constructes} són creats, no nascuts. Alguns se'ls programa amb certes instruccions simples, però a d'altres se'ls otorga consciència i llibertat d'acció. Exemples: qualsevol gòlem. Al pla exterior de Mechanous hi ha molts constructes fets a partir de la matèria pura del pla fets per criatures molt poderoses.",
								"Els {@b Dracs} són rèptils enormes d'origens ancians i de gran poder. Els dracs vertaders, com ara els dracs metàl·lics bons i els cromàtics malvats, són molt intel·ligents i tenen màgia innata. Com a drac també s'hi inclouen parents llunyans, però no són tant forts, intel·ligents, ni màgics, com ara els wíverns i els pseudo-dracs.",
								"Els {@b Elementals} són nadius dels plans elementals. Algunes d'aquestes criatures no són més que una mica del seu element animat, com ara una ràfega de vent. D'altres tenen formes biològiques imbuides amb energia elemental. Exemples: djinns, ifrits, que venen de les civilitzacions més importants dels plans elementals. Altres exemples: azers, assetjadors invisibles, i aiguextranyes aigüextranyes.",
								"Les {@b Fates} són éssers màgics propers a les forces de la natura. Viuen en fagedes de l'ocàs i en boscos boirosos. En alguns mons, estan lligats amb el Pla de les Fates, la Terra Fata. També se'n poden trobar als plans exteriors, com ara l'Arborea i la Terrabèstia. Exemple: dríades, píxis, i sàtirs.",

Clergues o mags malvats de vegades en convoquen al Pla Material perquè els facin la feina bruta. Un diastre d'alineament bo és gairebé inconcebible. Exemples: Dimonis, diables, cas de l'infern, rakshasas, i yugolòts.",

Tenen idioma i cultura, i de vegades màgia innata (o també poden aprendre llançament de conjurs), i són bípeds. Les races humanoides més communes són jugables: humans, nans, elfs, i mitgerols.

								"Les {@b Monstrositats} són monstres d'una forma estricte: criatures horripilants fora de l'odrinari, antinaturals i gairebé mai bones. Algunes apareixen degut a experiments catastròfics (mussolossos) i d'altres degut a una terrible maledicció (minotaures i yuan-ti). Són incategoritzables, així que en certa forma aquesta és la categoria on hi ha monstres que no encaixen en cap altre tipus.",
								"Els {@b Llims} són criatures gelatinoses que van canviant la seva forma. Són, sobretot, subterrànis, i habiten coves i masmorres i s'alimenten de deixalles, carronya, i criatures que els creuen el pas. Exemples: cubs gelatinosos, púdings negres.",
								"Les {@b Plantes}, com a monstres, no són flora ordinària. Moltes poden moure's i algunes són carnívores. Exemples: treants, piles trèmoles. Les criatures fetes de fongs com les espores de gas i els micònids també són plantes.",
								"Els {@b No-morts} eren vius, abans. Ara han tornat a la no-mort gràcies a una màgia necromàntica o alguna maledicció terrible. Són cadàvers que es mouen. Exemples: vampirs, zombis, i esperits incorporis, com ara fantasmes i espectres.",
