						"More than one thousand years ago, the wizard Halaster Blackcloak (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}) journeyed from a distant land to the base of Mount Waterdeep, perhaps acceding to the whispered summons of providence. Some believe he hailed from the nearly forgotten empire known as the Cradlelands. In ages past, humanity spread from the Cradlelands across Faerûn, originating from what is now the Plains of Purple Dust, a wasteland birthed out of a conflict with the gods. Others give Halaster less ancient origins, placing him among the early wizards of Netheril, or asserting that he came from a southern nation long since buried by sand and time. Whatever his origin, scholars have recorded that Halaster brought with him seven apprentices to Mount Waterdeep.",
						"With the Seven guarding his back, Halaster tapped into his immense power to summon beings from other planes of existence to help him build a wizard's tower to dwarf all other wizard's towers. But as the seasons wore on, the Seven saw less and less of their enigmatic master. Halaster continued to use fell creatures from distant planes for tunneling and other construction beneath his tower, and the wizard kept the nature of most of his underground dealings a secret from the Seven. Eventually, Halaster's exploration broke into the Underhalls, a complex of tunnels and rooms built by the nans around a mitrall mine beneath Mount Waterdeep. The architects of the Underhalls, the Melairkyn clan, had long ago been killed or dispersed, and warring duergar and drow had settled in the ruins. Halaster began a crusade against both the drow and the duergar, participating in wild hunts with extraplanar allies through the tunnels. The stubborn duergar dug in until the mitrall was largely mined out; then they abandoned the Underhalls, leaving the drow to fight Halaster and his minions alone. The Mad Mage rounded up the remaining dark elves, trapping some of their souls for use in his dark magic, while twisting the bodies and enslaving the minds of others. Once he had wrung the drow of their usefulness, Halaster Blackcloak tunneled on, ever downward, indulging his inexplicable compulsion for delving deeper and deeper into the mountain.",
						"Using his underground complex as a base of operations, Halaster traveled to other planes and distant lands, collecting strange and dangerous creatures to live as prisoners, servants, or guardians in Undermountain. Populating and defending the dungeon became an obsession. Over time, the mage's preoccupation with Undermountain electrified his eccentricities and infused him with an air of unconcealable madness.",
						"Halaster's apprentices came and went. Some left only to return\u2014inexplicably drawn down into Undermountain's depths. Others remained by his side. As they began dedicating more attention to their private obsessions, madness settled into their souls as well.",
						"During the years Halaster quested on other planes and sequestered himself in his tunnels, his magnificent tower and its surrounding walls fell into ruin. In time, the city now known as Waterdeep developed in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep and spread down to the harbor. As the city sprawled outward over the years, it came to surround the ruins of Halaster's home. Undermountain was known to those early settlers, and they often sent criminals into its endless depths as punishment. So it was for many years, until an intrepid adventurer named Durnan delved into the labyrinth beneath the tower and returned alive, laden with riches and countless harrowing tales. Durnan used his new fortune to demolish the remnants of Halaster's tower and built an inn over the well he had used to descend into Undermountain, and call it the Yawning Portal. Durnan owns and operates the inn and tavern to this day, serving patrons and inviting the brave and foolish alike to test their mettle in the Dungeon of the Mad Mage.",

								"Where Waterdeep stands today, there once stood Aelinthaldaar, the capital city of the ancient elven kingdom of Illefarn. When the elves left, they used a powerful spell to erase all traces of their capital. This spell had the unintended side effect of creating a permanent knot in the Weave, the fabric through which all magic is channeled. This knot lies deep underground and isn't something that can be seen, felt, or undone, but it can cause madness to bloom in the minds of mortal beings who dwell near it for too long. The knot permeates Undermountain, and the madness it causes typically manifests as an obsession with the dungeon itself. Those affected by the knot in the Weave exhibit a subconscious desire to remain in or near the dungeon. Halaster and several of his apprentices fell prey to this obsession, as did many Melairkyn nans and Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal. Not all creatures that dwell in Undermountain succumb to its madness, and those who do aren't even aware that the dungeon has them in its clutches."

						"The Yawning Portal, a famous inn and tavern located near the eastern slope of Mount Waterdeep, derives its name from a 40-foot-diameter well that descends into the first level of Undermountain. Located in the center of the taproom, the well was once the outer shell of Halaster's mighty tower, which was demolished long ago. Its sheer walls are made of old mortared stones. Next to this gaping orifice hangs a winch with a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that Durnan, the proprietor, uses to lower adventurers down the shaft and (sometimes) pull them up again. Durnan controls the winch himself and will transport only one adventurer at a time. The trip takes 10 rounds, down and up. The rope is stained with old blood and long enough to reach all the way to the floor of the dark room at the bottom of the 140-foot shaft ({@area level 1, area 1|035|x}).",
						"Durnan charges adventurers 1 gp each to descend into the well, whether they opt to use the rope or not. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. He also readily accepts coin from patrons who want to place grisly bets on adventurers who dare explore Undermountain, and their odds of returning alive. \"Five gold dragons says they're back before a tenday, minus the fighter, the wizard, and the cleric!\" is the flavor of commentary often heard amid gales of drunken laughter.",

Those the creature has contacted know nothing of the ulitharid's true nature, only that an alien intellect has reached out to them for information. Word of these telepathic intrusions has begun to spread throughout the city, gaining traction as more than just a mad rumor. Several of Durnan's regular patrons have spoken at length about it, and Durnan believes the source might be somewhere in Undermountain. In fact, he thinks a horrific, psionic monster called an elder brain might be lurking in the dungeon. Not wanting to alarm anyone with rumors of mind flayers, he keeps this conjecture to himself for now.",

The dagger allowed Azrok to become the powerful soldier and leader he was fated to be, and he was quickly promoted up through the ranks until none stood above him. Other goblinoids believed he was blessed by Maglubiyet, the great god of war. Azrok wisely hid the true source of his \"godsight\" to perpetuate the myth.",

His son, Azrokkog, chafed at his father's sedentary nature and left to wage wars of his own, eventually returning to Undermountain with a new name\u2014Doomcrown\u2014and a new purpose (see \"{@adventure Level 14: Arcturiadoom|WDMM|14}\").",

						"All location descriptions for this level are keyed to map 10. Adventurers most likely enter Muiral's Gauntlet by using the stairs from {@adventure level 9|WDMM|9} (near {@area area 1|55d|x}) or by descending a shaft into {@area area 3b|566|x}.",
						"Muiral's Gauntlet has architectural features commonly found in drow fortresses. Its 20-foot-wide, 30-foot-high corridors have arched ceilings bridged at regular intervals by web-like latticework arches serving as buttresses and rafters. Many of these \"web arches\" are cracked and broken. Shattered pieces of these arches lie scattered across the floor, as well as the remains of broken stone braziers carved in the shape of spiders. The bones of interlopers slain by Muiral also litter the dungeon.",
						"The 15-foot-tall double doors found throughout this level are carved with web patterns, their features chipped and worn.",

										"A teleport trap is {@condition invisible} to the senses, and a permanent {@spell Aura Màgica d'en Nystul} spell prevents divination spells such as {@spell detectar màgia} from revealing the trap's presence.
