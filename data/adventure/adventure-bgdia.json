						"The holy city of Elturel has disappeared from the Forgotten Realms and descended into Avernus, the first layer of els Nou Inferns. This event came about as the result of an infernal bargain between the archdevil Zariel, who rules Avernus, and the treacherous High Overseer of Elturel, Thavius Kreeg. Zariel is capturing cities and using their citizens as fodder in the ongoing conflict between demons and devils known as the Blood War. Next on Zariel's list of cities is Elturel's neighbor, Baldur's Gate. The characters can be the heroes who descend into Avernus, save Elturel from certain destruction, and prevent a similar fate from befalling Baldur's Gate.",

								"{@adventure Chapter 1|BGDIA|1} begins in the independent city of Baldur's Gate, where the characters find themselves trapped behind the city's walls after the gates are sealed to keep out hundreds of refugees from the neighboring land of Elturgard. However, the gates can't hold back news that Elturgard's capital has fallen, and that Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard of Baldur's Gate is missing\u2014lost on a diplomatic mission to Elturel. The fact that Elturel's misfortune coincided with Ravengard's visit has left Baldurians wondering whether Baldur's Gate will suffer Elturel's fate.",
								"The characters are drafted by the Flaming Fist, the army of mercenaries tasked with protecting Baldur's Gate. Without Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard to lead them, the Flaming Fist mercenaries are little more than glorified thugs. The characters' orders are to help maintain peace by rooting out and destroying followers of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul\u2014evil gods collectively known as the Dead Three. These vile priests, assassins, and necromancers are murdering city folk at random, and the Flaming Fist is too distracted and disorganized to hunt them down and find their lair. In the course of their investigation, the characters learn that the Dead Three cultists are secretly being financed by Thalamra Vanthampur, one of three remaining dukes who preside over the government of Baldur's Gate, using money stolen from the hoard of Tiamat, the evil queen of dragons imprisoned in els Nou Inferns.",
								"With Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard out of the way, Thalamra is paying the Dead Three to shatter confidence in the Flaming Fist so that all payments to the decapitated organization can be cut off. Thalamra, a devout disciple of the archdevil Zariel, has brokered a deal that will enable her to claim the role of grand duke once the Flaming Fist disbands, paving the way for the city's descent into Avernus. To accomplish this last goal, Thalamra needs an artifact called the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}, imprisoned in which is a pit fiend named Gargauth. Until recently, the shield was sealed in a tomb under the city, but Thalamra's sons recently stole it and transported it to the dungeon below their villa. So corrupt is the shield that its mere presence in Baldur's Gate has contributed to the city's moral decay for decades.",
								"To keep Baldur's Gate from falling into Zariel's clutches, the characters must take the shield far away from the city. Reya Mantlemorn, a young knight from Elturel, suspects that the Vanthampurs are sheltering Thavius Kreeg at their estate and offers aid. Characters who storm Duke Vanthampur's villa find Thavius hidden in the dungeon below it. Thavius is helping Thalamra Vanthampur use the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} to bring about the fall of Baldur's Gate, in much the same fashion he used the Companion (see \"{@area The Companion|007|x}\") to doom Elturel. If the characters slay Thavius, his soul travels to els Nou Inferns and re-forms as an amnizu devil on Avernus (see \"\"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\")."

Determined to thwart devil worshipers in positions of power throughout the Western Heartlands, Sylvira operates out of the library of Candlekeep and has spent years monitoring devil activity in Baldur's Gate, Elturel, and the surrounding region.

She can also facilitate the characters' descent into Avernus and provide them with a map (albeit an unreliable one). Sylvira advises characters to leave the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} in her custody. However, there are benefits to taking the shield with them, for Gargauth can guide them through els Nou Inferns in ways others cannot. With or without the shield, the characters depart Candlekeep and visit Sylvira's friend, Traxigor, a wizard who can use the {@spell saltar de pla} spell to get them to Elturel.

The beleaguered Ravengard urges the characters to do whatever they can to free Elturel and return what's left of it to Faer√ªn. To do so, they must scour Avernus for the means to destroy the Companion or break the enormous chains that shackle that city, as described in {@adventure chapter 3|BGDIA|3}.",
								"Avernus has long been a battlefield in the never-ending Blood War. Apart from clashing demons and devils, petty warlords scour the Avernian wastelands in search of treasure, salvage, and fuel for their infernal war machines. Characters who forge an alliance with one warlord risk alienating the others. By acquiring an infernal war machine, characters can travel quickly across Avernus\u2014a domain rife with tortured souls, warmongers, and devils eager to tempt would-be heroes into soul-corrupting deals.",
								"The more time she spends with the characters, the more Lulu begins to remember long-lost memories of the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}, an angelic weapon with the power to destroy the Companion. After Zariel's fall from grace, the sword was hidden in a stronghold called the Bleeding Citadel\u2014a celestial sanctuary trapped in Avernus. The quest for the sword forms the crux of {@adventure chapter 4|BGDIA|7}, leading to the revelation that Zariel can be redeemed.",
								"The characters' success doesn't hinge on acquiring the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA} or helping Zariel find redemption, as Gargauth is quick to point out should the characters consult with him. There are other ways to free Elturel, but only if the characters are willing to cut deals with Avernus's most evil denizens. The characters might broker a deal with the deposed archdevil Bel, who longs to supplant Zariel and regain his title as ruler of Avernus. They might stoke the rage of a horrific demon called Crokek'toeck and trick it into gnawing through Elturel's chains. They might come to terms with an evil dragonborn paladin named Arkhan the Cruel, using him to broker a deal with Tiamat. By returning her stolen treasure, characters can convince Tiamat to break Elturel's chains.",
								"As tempting as such pursuits can be, the characters must be careful, for devil deals, demon lords, and Tiamat's rage number among the multiverse's greatest threats. Also, Zariel herself might become cross with the characters for daring to meddle in her diabolical affairs. How the adventure concludes depends on the choices the characters make, the chaos they foment, and the deals they forge, as discussed in {@adventure chapter 5|BGDIA|8}.",

Yael took the sword and fled, along with Zariel's faithful hollyphant companion, Lulu. Zariel's other two generals, Olanthius and Haruman, refused to leave Zariel's side. All three were captured and sent to Nessus, the lowest of els Nou Inferns. There, Zariel was brought before Asmodeus, who welcomed her with open arms. The Lord of the Nine commended Zariel for her battle prowess and the strength of her convictions. He offered her rulership of Avernus, much to Bel's chagrin. By swearing fealty to Asmodeus and els Nou Inferns, Zariel could bring her rage to bear against the demons and continue to fight in the Blood War, with legions of devils under her command. Zariel accepted Asmodeus's terms, completing her fall from grace. Haruman followed his master into damnation willingly and was transformed into a narzugon devil, while Olanthius, who took his own life rather than bow before Asmodeus, was brought back to serve as a death knight under Zariel's burning gaze."

Facing political pressure at home, Ravengard reluctantly acceded. After greeting Ravengard's delegation, Thavius Kreeg fled Elturel in secret and watched from a safe distance as the Companion transformed from a radiant sun into a black orb awash with crackling energy. It ripped Elturel from the Material Plane, transporting it and all its inhabitants to Avernus. A few other city folk managed to escape before Elturel disappeared.

						"As the DM, you can play devils as humorous, aloof, bombastic, conniving, or scatterbrained, but a general rule to follow is this: devils have no desire to do good. When dealing with mortals, devils are constantly figuring out how to exploit and corrupt them, often behind thin smiles of feigned concern and false charm.",
						"A devil that successfully corrupts a mortal gets the infernal equivalent of a gold star and can eagerly expect a superior to take notice and give it the promotion it so richly deserves. Meanwhile, when that mortal dies, its soul will find itself condemned to els Nou Inferns where it twists into the form of a {@creature lemure} (unless it's used for some other morbid purpose). The devil doesn't care what becomes of the souls it corrupts; it just wants to be promoted to a superior form of devil. That's how, over ages, a {@creature lemure} might become a {@creature pit fiend}.",
						"But devils do more than corrupt. They also fight in the Blood War. Asmodeus attests that serving in his infernal legion is a holy honor, for in so doing a devil helps protect the multiverse from demonic destruction. While that sounds impressive, most devils partake in the Blood War only to distinguish themselves among their peers and move up the chain of command. Endlessly fighting demons isn't what most devils signed up for.",
						"If a devil dies somewhere other than els Nou Inferns, it re-forms in els Nou Inferns and is therefore not truly killed. However, a devil that is killed in els Nou Inferns is dead forever; not surprisingly, that's why devils tend to be more cautious in their dealings at home than abroad.",

								"{@b Patience}. Devils are rarely in a rush to make a deal or sign a contract. As masters of the long con, devils make genuinely good deals with mortals to buy appreciation and trust that can be leveraged during more consequential dealings later on.",
								"{@b Civility}. Devils like to pretend that they run by the same rules and obey the same social conventions as mortals. Devils have no problem appearing and acting in whatever manner they need to achieve their end goal\u2014usually a contract for services or a soul. They've learned that more can be gained from behaving in a civilized manner than reacting angrily or violently.",
								"{@b Deviousness}. Devils don't age, so there's rarely a sense of urgency with a devil as it plots its conquest or corruption of a soul. This allows for winding schemes that are rarely what they seem on the surface. For minor devils, a simple acceptance of an evil gift is enough, while greater devils enjoy tangling up characters in choices that compromise their values.",
								"{@b Unscrupulousness}. Being evil and soulless, a devil cannot be embarrassed or shamed, doesn't feel guilt or remorse, and is prepared to do the most heinous acts to get what it wants.",
								"{@b Fear of Demotion}. A devil that disappoints a superior can be demoted, whereupon it's instantly transformed into a lesser form of devil. The greater the devil, the more it fears demotion and the loss of its power. Thus, a devil takes great pains to hide its failures or pin them on someone else."

Before it could devour them, Yael plunged Zariel's holy blade into a stone as Lulu poured every ounce of her celestial being into it. A fortress sprang up around the sword, hedging out all evil. The effort so taxed Lulu that she became disoriented and flew away, leaving Yael behind.",

A rakshasa named Mahadi tricked her into thinking he was her friend, only to splash her with a tiny bit of water from the River Styx, leaving her in a feeble mental state and stripping away her spellcasting powers. Mahadi then gave Lulu to a group of devils as a gift for the archdevil Zariel. Zariel could not abide Lulu's presence\u2014but nor could she bring herself to harm her former friend. Zariel had Lulu sent back to Faer√ªn with her mental faculties restored. Unfortunately, the damage to Lulu's memory was not so easy to repair."

For example, if the characters end at a 10 on the scale, they get everything they want from Mad Maggie: one or more vehicles to expedite travel across Avernus, all the information they need, monetary or magical gifts, and provisions. If they end at a 1 on the scale, they anger Mad Maggie and get nothing. They might even have to fight their way out of Fort Knucklebone. As long as the characters still have a path forward, a spectacular failure can be just as memorable as success.",

Included in these descriptions are the personalities and goals of the NPCs, as well as what they have to offer the characters. These descriptions also allow you, as the DM, to determine how the characters can gain leverage in the negotiations and get what they want or need.",
										"Use the 1-to-10 scale as a barometer for rating the overall success of the characters in dealing with the strange, intriguing, and dangerous world of Mad Maggie and the Knucklebones. Let the characters' decisions, insights, knowledge, roleplaying, successes, and failures move the slider up or down the scale as you see fit.",
