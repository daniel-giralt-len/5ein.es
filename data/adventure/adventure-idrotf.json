				"North of the Spine of the World and west of the towering Reghed Glacier is a frigid expanse few dare to explore, let alone inhabit. This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a perpetual, dark winter without reprieve. Auril the Frostmaiden, the divine embodiment of winter's fury, has withdrawn to this cold corner of the world to live among mortals. Further, she has cast a terrible spell over Icewind Dale, to the detriment of most of its denizens.",
				"Each night before midnight, Auril takes to the sky on the back of a white roc and weaves her spell, which manifests as a shimmering curtain of light\u2014a beautiful aurora that illuminates the night sky and fades before dawn. This powerful magic prevents the next day's sun from rising above the horizon, turning midday into twilight and trapping Icewind Dale in winter's dark embrace, with no sunlight or warmth to melt the snow and ice. Each casting of the spell leaves the Frostmaiden weakened, with just enough divine power left to barricade the mountain pass with blizzards and churn the Sea of Moving Ice with blistering winds. Such measures discourage travelers from approaching or leaving Icewind Dale, further isolating the region. Icewind Dale has thus been trapped in a different reality from the rest of the world, for though the sun never rises over the dale, it continues to rise everywhere else.",
				"The people of Icewind Dale know Auril's wrath when they feel it, and they have a name for the unending winter she has inflicted on them. They call it the Everlasting Rime. No one understands why the Frostmaiden has imposed her will in this way or why the other gods refuse to challenge her. This prolonged winter, which has gone on for more than two years, threatens to doom not just the flickering lights of civilization known as Ten-Towns but also the indigenous flora and fauna that need sunlight and the change of seasons to survive.",
				"Not all creatures are discouraged by what has transpired north of the Spine of the World. The long nights and sunless days are a blessing to Xardorok Sunblight, a duergar who longs to carve out a domain for himself on the surface and enslave the people of Ten-Towns in the process. Already, he has taken advantage of Auril's magic and raised a fortress amid the dark shadows of the mountains. From here, his underlings strike out across the tundra in search of chardalyn\u2014a crystalline substance known to exist only in Icewind Dale. Once he gathers enough of it, Xardorok plans to construct a chardalyn dragon and unleash it upon Ten-Towns.",
				"Despite Auril's blizzards and other deterrents, visitors still come and go. Among the recent arrivals are four wizards of the Germanor Arcana, a powerful society of spellcasters based in Luskan. They've come chasing rumors of a lost city buried under the Reghed Glacier\u2014a fragment of the long-gone Empire of Netheril, whose wizards wielded magic that terrified the gods. Netherese magic has a way of attracting power-hungry wizards, as members of the Germanor Arcana often are. The cities of Netheril floated among the clouds, making them almost impervious to assault for centuries. Then, nearly two thousand years ago, this floating city crashed during the fall of the empire, and no one has found or explored it since. It is, arguably, Icewind Dale's greatest secret\u2014a necropolis of Netherese wizards and the magic they left behind. What survived the crash is anyone's guess, but we're about to find out!",

In the years since, more deposits of chardalyn have been found across Icewind Dale. Like the {@i Crystal Shard}, these deposits tend to be suffused with demonic magic. Prolonged contact with chardalyn that has become suffused with demonic magic can warp a creature's mind, causing madness that usually fades away once the contact is broken.",

A chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Upper Planes is considered a consecrated object, while a chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Lower Planes is considered a desecrated object; both can be identified as such using a {@spell detectar el bé i el mal} spell or similar magic.",

Some came here determined to make their fortunes. Others come for the solitude, or to escape notice and stay out of the reach of the law of the southern cities. Today, four hundred years after the formation of Ten-Towns, most folk are here because they were born here, grew up here, and expect to die here. They're fishers, loggers, miners, hunters, trappers, furriers, and traders accustomed to the harsh climate, the slow pace, and the isolation. Like the hardy lichens and determined reindeer of the tundra, residents endure and do what's needed to survive.",

One by one, settlements sprung up on the shores of Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters. The ever-present threat of orcs and other monsters compelled the poorly defended lakeside towns to turn Bryn Shander from a modest hilltop trading post into a walled town capable of defending all Ten-Towners if and when the worst comes.",

Small thermal vents at the bottom of these lakes keep them from freezing completely, even in the coldest winters.",

When the castle, dubbed Caer-Dineval, was completed, the workers and their families settled in the outbuildings they had constructed farther down the cliff, along with the families of the retainers the Dinevs had brought with them. Over the next few years, many explorers in the region came to see the Caer for themselves, and some built cottages in the shadow of its walls. No sooner had the small town taken hold than marauding orcs swept down from the tundra to put it to the torch. The town's residents tried to take refuge in the castle, but the Dinevs, alarmed by the size of the orc horde, barred the gates and refused to open them. The orcs fell upon the stranded people and slaughtered them to the last one. The Dinevs survived the initial assault, but not the siege that followed. After three weeks of being confined in the Caer, the Dinevs were so weakened by hunger that they were unable to resist when the orcs scaled the castle walls. Thus, the Dinev family's brief rule in Icewind Dale came to a bloody end.",

The goblins who triggered the avalanche captured Spellix's mates and dragged them back to their caves in the mountains to be eaten. Spellix, whom the goblins overlooked, followed them and devised a cunning plan to free his companions. Using materials scavenged from the wrecked caravan, he engineered a costume for himself. Disguised as a half-metal goblin, he infiltrated the goblins' lair and did his best to fit in, cleverly using {@spell imatge silenciosa} spells to hide the imperfections in his disguise. When he was offered a bone to gnaw on, his mechanical goblin mouth malfunctioned and wouldn't stop grinding its teeth. Thus, Spellix Romwod came to be known as Yarb-Gnock, which means \"Ever-Gnawing\" in Goblin.",

Abandoning all concern for his former mates, whom he didn't particularly like anyway, Spellix adopted the name given to him by the goblins and spent the next several months engineering ways to improve their standard of living. Long after the other members of the caravan had been eaten, Yarb-Gnock became the new chief after the previous one choked to death on a mountain goat tongue. By then, Yarb-Gnock had already drawn up plans to build a fortress in the mountains. Karkolohk, the Gnomish word for \"home,\" became the goblin tribe's dream of a better future.",
										"As the goblins were finishing construction of their new home, everlasting winter descended upon Icewind Dale. Fewer caravans made their way through the mountain pass, forcing Chief Yarb-Gnock to send goblin wagons far and wide in search of food and resources. Despite his best efforts, the gnome-in-goblin's-clothing could sense that the tribe was becoming increasingly frustrated. The goblins felt like they were working harder for less, and a few are beginning to suspect that Chief Yarb-Gnock is a fraud.",
										"Cooped up in the cold with creatures that would kill him if they learned the truth, Chief Yarb-Gnock is running out of ideas to keep the goblins motivated on other tasks and has begun to fear that the goblins are on to him. His costume is beginning to come apart, and paranoia has made him sleep-deprived. The number of \"traitors\" hurled from the mountaintop increases with every cycle of the moon, and the goblins don't know who among them are Yarb-Gnock's loyal spies.

(This object was jettisoned from an illithid nautiloid soon before it crashed in the mountains to the east, as described in \"{@area Id Ascendant|346|x}\"), Chief Yarb-Gnock thinks the crate might hold something wondrous, and getting it open has become his new obsession."
